Who created us? When I ask this question the very common answer I get is “Of course, God created us”. Damn it dude then who created the God in the first place? I mean wait, which God are we talking about? Since the evolution of humans, there have been thousands of Gods created by humans. Krishna, Titans, Jesus, Buddha didn’t we create them? but why? Why did we create them? Where did this idea of God come from? And then came the religions, castes, communities so many differences! I’m not answering these questions in this blog but I’m going to write about my opinion on these. (MY THOUGHTS)

What would you do if you were given a time machine? Would you travel to the past or the future? I’ve been asking this question for almost a decade now to everyone I acquaint with and the most common answer I get is to the future, the second most common is to go back a few years back and change something in their past. But if you ask me I’ll go back at least 5000 years back first to see how superly human was Lord Rama and then I’ll go and see how did they build those pyramids which are perfectly aligned to the constellation of stars which are more than a half a thousand light-years away! If they had done it with this much precision they couldn’t be the humans what we are now. This is just an example of what ancient humans did. We all must’ve read about so many more archeological mysteries that are not solved yet. City of Atlantis, Mayan civilization, and so many more! How did that all happen or what happened to all of them? So many theories and guesses but no proof. I don’t think it was God who did all these. Human evolution was at peak back then. Now I’m not sure if we are evolving or devolving. The researchers say the human body can’t devolve biologically but why do we all have a dormant photosensitive gland just behind our master gland inside our brain? Why did we stop using it? Why did we use it before? Again so many unanswered questions and many more theories.

You see that tiny blue dot? That’s how much area we have covered so far with our Radio waves. This is an image of Milky way galaxy with an radius of about 53K Light-years with approximately 40K Crores of stars in which our Sun is one of them. This is just one galaxy in our Universe. There are about more than 100 billion galaxies estimated by our Hubble but there could be way more than that! And this is just in our Universe. Studies shows that we could be living in a multiverse where there are many universes like ours. Isn’t it amazing? To know that this cosmos came out of a singularity where there is no time and space. Sometimes I feel how tiny we are in this never ending cosmos. Who created that singularity? Who made it to expand? How did this all start? Many questions. Many theories.

The point is, in this huge cosmos being a minuscule creature with so many unanswered questions do we really need a God? What if I say each one of us is a God ourselves? What will it take for us to believe in ourselves?
